# To Do List (So I don't forget...)

[X] Capture error when adding too much text and make more user friendly (and warning?)
[ ] Make _enmvPrep.ps1 part of workflow rather than calling it in the Pester tests
[ ] Setup workflow to test on commit, and build on PR
[ ] Do help then tests for Add-BTAppLogo
[X] Add test coverage (and example?) for text languages in Add-BTText
[ ] Config item: always passthru on Add-* functions
