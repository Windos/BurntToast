# TODO

- [ ] Update comment passed help for all functions
    - [ ] Grab/use/adapt parameter help from the UWP Community Toolkit
	- [ ] Consider Markdown/External help (platyPS), help link could then link to MD file on GitHub for online viewing (noice!)
- [X] Include public function to toggle functionlevel between basic/advanced
    - [ ] Need a function based way to edit other config items: default appid/applogo?
- [ ] Allow path to (supported) media files for toast audio
- [ ] Include parameter validation where appropriate
- [ ] Credential parameter was removed during re-write, is it actually needed? Consider just checking and warning, leave to user to re-run as correct account.
- [X] Check if app id is valid, and offer to create - or otherwise provide guidance - the required registry item.
- [ ] See if anything from UWP Community Toolkit has been included that doesn't apply to Toasts and/or desktop only apps. No point exposing mobile only features, for example.
- [ ] AdaptiveGroup
- [ ] ToastGenericAttributionText
- [ ] Ensure ContextMenuItems and SelectionBoxes actually work.
- [ ] ActivationOptions
