# TODO

- [ ] Update comment passed help for all functions

  - [ ] Grab/use/adapt parameter help from the UWP Community Toolkit
  - [ ] Consider Markdown/External help (platyPS), help link could then link to MD file on GitHub for online viewing (noice!)

- [X] Include public function to toggle functionlevel between basic/advanced

  - [ ] Need a function based way to edit other config items: default appid/applogo?

- [ ] Allow path to (supported) media files for toast audio

- [ ] Include parameter validation where appropriate

- [ ] Credential parameter was removed during re-write, is it actually needed? Consider just checking and warning, leave to user to re-run as correct account.

- [X] Check if app id is valid, and offer to create - or otherwise provide guidance - the required registry item.

- [ ] See if anything from UWP Community Toolkit has been included that doesn't apply to Toasts and/or desktop only apps. No point exposing mobile only features, for example.

- [ ] AdaptiveGroup

- [ ] ToastGenericAttributionText

- [ ] Ensure ContextMenuItems and SelectionBoxes actually work.

- [ ] ActivationOptions
