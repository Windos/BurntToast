      Thanks for using BurntToast and taking the time to fill out a bug report! üíú

      Please check to see if your problem already exists with a quick search of the issues. Start with one relevant term and then add others if you get too many results.

      Name your issue appropriately: give it a sentence that reads well enough for anyone seeing this in the release notes to know what it is.

      When writing out the issue details, please ensure you are writing it as if you were explaining it to somebody else, even if you will be working on and resolving the issue yourself.
      This helps others to understand the reasons for the issue and for it to be searchable in the future.
